Here I will record my understanding and designing project of game.
# 1. Knowledge
## 1.1 Design Learning
### 1.1.1 3D Model Design：Spline
- [My first 3D Website](https://my.spline.design/untitled-526254d973b4730b56354faf2d6996f8/)
- [One carrot in Spline](https://my.spline.design/librarycarrot-ae614eef77fd5934bfb2b03e30a6ceaa/)
### 1.1.2 Computer Science Programming Design:
- [MotionCanvas](https://motioncanvas.io/docs/quickstart)
## 1.2. Development Learning
### 1.2.1 Game Concept Design
- Rigidbody: allows a game object to move under the control of the physics system. It can accept external forces and torque to ensure that the game object moves as if in the real world. Only game objects with a Rigidbody component will be affected by gravity.
- Collider: a type of physics component that needs to be added to a game object along with a Rigidbody to trigger collisions. When two Rigidbodies collide, the physics engine calculates the collision only if both objects have Colliders. In the absence of Colliders, Rigidbodies will pass through each other.
- Asset: refers to any resource used in a Unity project, such as models, textures, sound files, etc. In Unity, resources are managed and used in the form of Assets.
  - Model: Three-dimensional model files, such as characters, environments, and props.
  - Texture: Image files used to color the surfaces of models or scenes, such as skin, wood, or brick wall textures.
  - Material: Defines the visual properties of a model or scene's surface, such as glossiness, color, or transparency.
  - Audio: Audio files used for adding sound effects or music.
  - Script: Code files for writing game logic.
  - Animation: Used to define the animation behavior of objects in models or scenes.
  - Scene: Files that contain game levels or scenes, including all game objects and settings.Materials, Textures, Terrain, Lighting, Skeletal Animation.
